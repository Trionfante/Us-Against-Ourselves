# Us-Against-Ourselves

Documentation for my mind.

This is my attempt to write down the ever-present chaos in my head, especially during my every break down from General Anxiety Disorder, which sometime leads to suicidal tendencies when it is too much. Years back, it was another severe recurrence, one of the lowest point yet that time- and I don't exactly remember my thought process but I decided that, if I am able to, then I want to be able to help other who is suffering more or less the same thing as me. I still find it somewhat silly, the idea of a sick person tending another one.

I didn't take any psychology class from any educational institution, and most of what I understand came from my own observation of myself, other people and the whole causalities inbetween social interaction, that, plus Google for factual diagnose and theories. This, I think, put me in the gray zone, in sense that I am not licensed or simply qualified to attempt to help others, as the way I understand it, if I happen to make a mistake in my attempt, then it is not unlikely i will or have already made the said person's condition worse than it was, and, the more terrifying possibilities that they will go in that worsened state, doing all the horrors- the very thing I don't want to happen. - 23 July 2019
