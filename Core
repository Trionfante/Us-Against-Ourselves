For they who keep on living
Not because they want to
But because otherwise
To those who they owe
Will be brought upon
Hardship and troubles

For they who are silent
Not because they have kept to themselves
But because they are not heard
Whose voices dried out
Forgotten and ignored
Confused and scared

For they who have been made to lie
Who have nothing left but lies
Made to lie by lies brought upon them
Who keep on lying
Lying to no one but themselves
Who knew, but couldn't bear the truth anymore

For they who are bleeding
Beaten relentlessly against their attempt
Containing their beast of Chaos
For the sake of those around them
Who have to fight on their own
Fighting their very own self

Be it good, be it bad
All that you have ever had
Everything that we are to get
Be our moonrise, be our sunset
When you're happy, when you're sad
You were all mine
